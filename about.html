<h4>Resume</h4>






<p>I am a senior Graphic Design student at WVU. Let's go Mountaineers! I was born and raised in Charleston, West Virginia and the Wild and Wonderful state has made me into the creative, and active person I am today. Itâ€™s easy to find inspiration in a place like WV, it will always have my heart, but I also love to explore. 

Spring of 2013 I attended a study abroad program at Central St. Martins College of Art and Design in London, UK. London has been the best experience of my life. Not only did I learn a tremendous amount of design theory. I was inspired beyond measure by the city, the art, and lifetime friends
